# Buttermilk Banana Bread: Old Fashioned Recipe

![Buttermilk Banana Bread: Old Fashioned Recipe](/images/old-fashioned-buttermilk-banana-bread-hero.webp)

There is something undeniably comforting about a warm slice of banana bread. However, this isn't just any loaf; this is the **Old Fashioned Buttermilk Banana Bread**. As Chef Galot, I have tested countless variations, but the addition of buttermilk is the "secret weapon" of American grandmothers. It breaks down the gluten for a tender crumb and adds a subtle tang that balances the sweetness of the overripe bananas perfectly.

## Ingredients

To achieve that professional bakery texture, precision is key. Here are the ingredients you need, with my expert recommendations and simple alternatives.

*   **Bananas:** 3 large, very ripe (Must be spotted brown or black).
*   **Cultured Buttermilk:** 1/3 cup. The acidity is crucial for the baking soda activation.
*   **Unsalted Butter:** 1/2 cup, melted and slightly cooled.
*   **Granulated Sugar:** 3/4 cup.
*   **Large Eggs:** 2, at room temperature.
*   **All-Purpose Flour:** 1 3/4 cups.
*   **Baking Soda & Salt:** Essential for rise and flavor balance.

## Instructions

Follow these steps precisely to ensure your bread rises beautifully and stays moist.

1.  **Preparation:** Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan with butter or non-stick spray.
2.  **Mash the Fruit:** In a large bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork. You want a consistency that is mostly smooth but still has small chunks for texture.
3.  **Mix Wet Ingredients:** Stir the melted butter into the mashed bananas. Add the sugar, beaten eggs, vanilla extract, and buttermilk. Whisk until fully combined.
4.  **Combine Dry Ingredients:** In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt.
5.  **The Fold:** Gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet mixture. **Stop mixing as soon as the flour streaks disappear.** Overmixing yields a tough bread. Fold in the nuts now if using.

6.  **Bake:** Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan. Bake for 55 to 65 minutes.
7.  **The Toothpick Test:** Insert a toothpick into the center of the loaf. It should come out clean or with just a few moist crumbs, but no raw batter.
8.  **Cool:** Let the bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.

## Chef Galot's Tips

*   **Ripeness Matters:** The darker the banana peel, the sweeter and more intense the banana flavor will be. Black peels are actually ideal.
*   **Don't Overmix:** I cannot stress this enough. Once the wet and dry ingredients meet, use a spatula and be gentle. This ensures the "Old Fashioned" tenderness.

*   **Storage:** This bread tastes even better the next day. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and store at room temperature.
