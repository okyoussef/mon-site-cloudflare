# One-Bowl Banana Bread (Less Cleanup!)

As Chef Galot, I have baked thousands of loaves, but nothing beats the humble, comforting simplicity of a classic Banana Bread. The problem? Usually, the sink full of dishes that follows. 

This recipe is designed for the modern home cook who demands **bakery-quality texture**—moist crumb, crispy crust, deep caramel notes—without the bakery-level mess. We use exactly one mixing bowl and one fork (or whisk). No electric mixers required.

## Why This Recipe Works
*   **Melted Butter Base:** Creates a denser, fudgier crumb compared to creamed butter.
*   **Minimal Agitation:** Mixing by hand prevents overworking the gluten, ensuring the bread remains tender, not rubbery.
*   **Efficiency:** From the counter to the oven in under 15 minutes.

## Ingredients: The Chef's Selection

To achieve that professional depth of flavor, I recommend specific ingredients, but I have provided accessible alternatives for your convenience.

*   **Heavily Spotted Cavendish Bananas (Any very overripe banana):** 3 large or 4 medium. They must be brown/black for sweetness.
*   **Unsalted European Cultured Butter (Standard unsalted butter):** ½ cup (115g), melted and slightly cooled.
*   **Muscovado Sugar (Dark Brown Sugar):** ¾ cup (150g). Adds moisture and molasses notes.
*   **Large Organic Egg (Standard large egg):** 1 unit, room temperature.
*   **Pure Vanilla Bean Paste (Vanilla extract):** 1 teaspoon.
*   **Organic All-Purpose Flour (Standard plain flour):** 1 ½ cups (190g).
*   **Baking Soda:** 1 teaspoon.
*   **Fine Sea Salt (Table salt):** ½ teaspoon.

## Chef Galot's Pro Tips

1.  **The "Ripeness" Rule:** If your bananas are yellow, wait. They need to be spotted or black. If you are desperate, bake unpeeled bananas on a baking sheet at 300°F for 15 minutes until black to simulate ripening.
2.  **Pan Material Matters:** If using a glass pan, reduce the temperature to 325°F (165°C) and check it 5 minutes earlier. Metal pans yield the best crust.
3.  **Storage:** This bread tastes even better the next day. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap once cool to trap the moisture.
