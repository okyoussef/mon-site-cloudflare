faq:
  - question: "How ripe should bananas be for banana bread?"
    answer: "For the best flavor and moisture, your bananas should be streaked with black/brown spots or completely brown. Yellow bananas lack the necessary sugar content and softness."
  - question: "Can I freeze this banana bread?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Wrap the completely cooled loaf (or individual slices) tightly in plastic wrap and then foil. It freezes well for up to 3 months."
  - question: "Why is my banana bread dry?"
    answer: "Dryness usually comes from over-measuring flour or over-baking. Use the spoon-and-level method for flour and check the loaf at the 50-minute mark."

# Introduction Passionnante par Sarah Baker

There is nothing quite like the smell of a **moist homemade banana bread** baking in the oven to make a house feel like a home. Over the years, I have tested dozens of variations, but I always come back to this classic, no-fuss version. It is the absolute best way to save those **overripe bananas** sitting on your counter from the trash bin, transforming them into a tender, sweet treat that pairs perfectly with your morning coffee.

What makes this recipe truly stand out is its simplicity and texture. We aren't using fancy mixers here; just a bowl, a fork, and some love. The secret to that incredible crumb lies in using **melted butter** instead of oil, which gives the loaf a rich, buttery flavor that vegetable oil just can't compete with. Whether you are an experienced baker or a complete novice looking for an **easy breakfast recipe**, this banana bread is foolproof and delivers consistent, delicious results every single time.
