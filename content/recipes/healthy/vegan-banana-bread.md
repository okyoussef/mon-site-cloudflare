This vegan banana bread is a game-changer. You won't believe there are no eggs or dairy in it!

### Why use Almond Milk?
It adds a nutty flavor that complements the bananas perfectly. You can also use oat milk for a creamier texture.

### Sweetener Choice
Maple syrup gives a deeper, more caramel-like flavor than white sugar, and keeps the bread incredibly moist.
