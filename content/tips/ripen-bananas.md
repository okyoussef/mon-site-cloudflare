We've all been there: you want to bake, but your bananas are stubbornly yellow (or worse, green!). Don't worry, science has the answer.

## Method 1: The Oven (Fastest)
Place unpeeled bananas on a baking sheet. Bake at 300°F (150°C) for 15-20 minutes until the skins are completely black. The heat releases the sugars.

## Method 2: The Paper Bag (Overnight)
Place bananas in a paper bag with an apple. The ethylene gas released by the apple will speed up the ripening process.

## Method 3: The Microwave (Emergency Only)
Pierce the peel with a fork. Microwave for 30 seconds at a time. Texture might be a bit weird, but it works for baking.
