      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-best-gluten-free-banana-bread-almond-flour&#34;&gt;The Best Gluten-Free Banana Bread (Almond Flour)&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I still remember the panic during a busy Saturday brunch service. A high-profile food critic walked in, announcing a severe gluten intolerance but demanding &amp;ldquo;comfort food.&amp;rdquo; I couldn&amp;rsquo;t serve our standard brioche. I grabbed the over-ripe bananas we were saving for smoothies and the bag of superfine almond flour usually reserved for macarons. What came out of the oven wasn&amp;rsquo;t just a substitute; it was a revelation. That accidental creation evolved into &lt;strong&gt;The Best Gluten-Free Banana Bread (Almond Flour)&lt;/strong&gt; I have ever tasted. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t dry or cardboard-like; it was rich, fudgy, and possessed a depth of flavor that wheat flour simply masks. This recipe isn&amp;rsquo;t just a &amp;ldquo;healthy alternative&amp;rdquo;—it is superior pastry work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
