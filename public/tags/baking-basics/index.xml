      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stop throwing away gold. In the world of culinary science, there is perhaps no greater tragedy than a spotted banana ending up in the compost bin simply because of its aesthetic decline. As a culinary scientist, I look at a brown, spotted banana and I don&amp;rsquo;t see rot—I see a biological sugar factory that has completed its production cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most home bakers understand intuitively that brown bananas make better bread, but few understand the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;. It isn&amp;rsquo;t just about softness; it is about a complex molecular transformation that changes the chemical landscape of the fruit. When you master the science of the &amp;ldquo;sugar spot,&amp;rdquo; you stop looking for recipes to use up old fruit and start intentionally aging your produce to achieve specific Brix (sugar) levels. This guide isn&amp;rsquo;t just about fruit; it&amp;rsquo;s about unlocking the enzymatic potential of your pantry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
