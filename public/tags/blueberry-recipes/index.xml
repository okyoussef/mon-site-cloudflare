      <description>&lt;p&gt;Forget everything you know about dry, lackluster quick breads where the fruit ends up as a soggy layer at the bottom of the pan. We are not making a simple snack here; we are engineering a masterpiece of hydration and suspension. This Blueberry Banana Bread is the result of years of testing the interplay between fructose, gluten structure, and thermal dynamics. We are aiming for a specific texture profile: a dense, tight crumb that remains incredibly moist for days, punctuated by exploding pockets of tart blueberry jam. This is the recipe that separates the home bakers from the culinary artists.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
