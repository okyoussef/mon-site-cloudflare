      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have all been there. You stare at the fruit bowl, watching a bunch of bananas transition from a cheerful yellow to an ominous, spotted brown. The instinct is often to toss the entire bunch, peels and all, into the deep freeze and forget about them until a craving for banana bread strikes three months later.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop doing this.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a culinary scientist, I can tell you that throwing a whole, unpeeled banana into the freezer is the &amp;ldquo;rookie mistake&amp;rdquo; of the baking world. You are essentially creating a future obstacle for yourself—trying to peel a slimy, thawing casing off a mushy interior is a sensory nightmare. More importantly, it impacts the accuracy of your baking measurements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
