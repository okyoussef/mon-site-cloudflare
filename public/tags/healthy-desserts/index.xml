      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a pervasive myth in the culinary world that gluten-free baking requires a sacrifice in texture—that one must accept a dry, crumbly, or gummy mouthfeel as the price of admission. I am here to dismantle that notion entirely. When we approach baking as a science, we understand that gluten is simply a structural protein. When we remove it, we must replace it with an alternative architectural support system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this specific formulation for Banana Bread, we utilize the unique lipid profile and protein structure of &lt;strong&gt;almond flour&lt;/strong&gt;. Unlike wheat flour, which relies on the elasticity of gluten strands to trap air, almond flour provides a dense, rich, and incredibly moist crumb due to its high fat content. When combined with the pectin and natural sugars found in over-ripe bananas, the result is a loaf that is not just &amp;ldquo;good for gluten-free,&amp;rdquo; but superior to many traditional wheat-based recipes. The aroma of caramelized fructose and toasted nuts that fills the kitchen is merely the prelude to a sensory experience defined by a luxurious, velvet-like density that melts on the palate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
