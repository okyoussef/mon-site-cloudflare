      <description>&lt;p&gt;I still remember the first time I tried to replicate the iconic Starbucks banana bread. I was twenty-two, working in a cramped apartment kitchen with an oven that had two settings: &amp;ldquo;inferno&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;off.&amp;rdquo; I used four sticks of butter, barely ripe yellow bananas, and mixed the batter until my arm hurt. The result? A dry, rubbery brick that could have served as a doorstop. It was heartbreaking. I could smell the potential—the caramelized sugar, the warm vanilla—but the texture was a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
